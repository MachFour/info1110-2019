# About

This repo is meant for students of INFO1110, particularly those in my (Max's) lab classes.
Python code that I upload here may be either code snippets I used in class, or partial answers to some lab questions.

For some weeks, I have written introductory explanations to the concepts of that week, to supplement the lab material.

Note: what I upload here is not official course material, and while mostly the code is correct, I cannot guarantee that it is. You should *always* run code yourself to make sure that it does what you think it does.
